<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Dryer Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat dryer systems are primarily categorized into two market types: direct and indirect types. Direct heat dryers transfer hot air directly to the material, enabling fast drying but may risk product contamination. They are often used in applications requiring quick results. Indirect heat dryers, on the other hand, use a heated surface or medium to dry materials without direct contact, offering better control over temperature and reduced contamination risk, making them suitable for sensitive materials and situations where purity is crucial.</p></p>
