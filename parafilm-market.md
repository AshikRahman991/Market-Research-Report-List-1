<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parafilm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Non-thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parafilm is a flexible, self-sealing film used in laboratories for sealing containers. The market for Parafilm can be categorized into thermoplastic and non-thermoplastic types. Thermoplastic Parafilm softens when heated and hardens upon cooling, making it ideal for applications requiring heat sealing. Non-thermoplastic Parafilm does not melt or change under heat, offering durability and resistance to temperature fluctuations. Both types cater to diverse lab needs, with thermoplastic variants being more common for heat-sensitive tasks, while non-thermoplastic options are preferred for stability in varying conditions.</p></p>
