<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IDO Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors</li><li>Covalent IDO inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IDO inhibitors target the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme pathway, vital for regulating immune responses. The market comprises two main types: dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors, which simultaneously obstruct both IDO1 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), enhancing immune checkpoint blockade efficacy; and covalent IDO inhibitors, designed to form irreversible bonds with IDO, ensuring prolonged inhibition. Both types aim to overcome immune evasion by tumors and are explored for their potential in oncology and other inflammatory diseases.</p></p>
