<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glass market primarily features two types of coatings: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic coatings attract water, allowing dirt and contaminants to be washed away easily when it rains. They create a smooth surface that enhances water spreading, resulting in improved cleaning efficiency. In contrast, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to form droplets that roll off the surface, carrying dirt with them. Both types aim to reduce maintenance and enhance the longevity of glass in various applications.</p></p>
