<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual Line Distributors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-way Output</li><li>Two-way Output</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual Line Distributors operate in two market types: One-way Output and Two-way Output. In the One-way Output market, the distributor handles product input from manufacturers and delivers it to retailers without feedback or return flow of goods. Conversely, the Two-way Output market allows for a reciprocal flow, where not only are products distributed to retailers, but unsold or returned items can also flow back to the distributor, facilitating inventory management and enhancing supplier-retailer relationships.</p></p>
