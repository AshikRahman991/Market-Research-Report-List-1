<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG guns are vital for TIG welding, and they come in two primary types: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled TIG guns utilize a coolant system to dissipate heat, making them suitable for prolonged welding tasks, especially in high-current applications. They are typically more efficient and comfortable to use. In contrast, air-cooled TIG guns rely on ambient air for cooling, making them more portable and easier to manage for lighter welding jobs, but they may overheat during extended use.</p></p>
